python main.py
```

The application will:
1. Fetch your GitHub commit history for the specified number of days
2. Analyze each commit for file changes and statistics
3. Update your Obsidian daily notes with the GitHub activity section
4. Display a summary of processed data

## Output Format

The application adds a "üìä GitHub Activity" section to your daily notes with AI summaries, commit details, and time estimates.

Example output:
```markdown
## üìä GitHub Activity
